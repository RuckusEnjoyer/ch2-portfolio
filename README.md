# RuckusEnjoyer's Portfolio

## Description
I created this webpage in order to store my portfolio and show off my most successful webpages. When making this webpage, I learned how to use flexbox and media queries to make a website more flexible based on screens. 

I faced a few challenges when making this piece, and it may be imperfect right now. My Devtools' device toolbar kept breaking, and each time I would fix the problem, the next time I unloaded and reloaded the page the issue would arise again for seemingly no reason. 

In the future, I plan to implement each website I create, both in my freetime as well as other projects I am working on through the bootcamp. I will also update my contact information once this bootcamp is complete.
