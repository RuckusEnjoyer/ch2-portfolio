                    I am a learning front-end website developer. My web development story started as a content author for a literary magazine, and I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through edX. I am planning to specialize in Front end, however by the time my bootcamp is completed I will have experience in both front end as well as back end development. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I am also an artist and a character designer. Because of this, my work mainly surrounds writing character sheets and creating containers for my character's stories. When creating webpages, I focus the most on aesthetically pleasing design and accessibility.
